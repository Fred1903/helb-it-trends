## Australia wants to ban social media for under 16 years old people

Australia government will introduce "world-leading" legislation to ban social media for children under 16.

### Introduction

As you certainly know, teenagers spend more and more time behind their screens. They can play video games but most of them are also using a lot social media. These social medias can harm mental health of adolescents believing most experts. 
This is because of being addict but some of the kids are also victim of harassment on social media.

### Vote next week in parliament

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that this law will be discussed next week in Australian parliament. He also said "This is for mums and dads..." who might agree with him. It is also important to note that this ban will not affect young australians already using social media.


### No Exemptions 

If the vote leads to the ban, there will be no exemptions for children who have the permissions to use social medias from theire parents. In case of not respecting this law, they won't be given charges against the childrens and it is the job of Australia's online regulator to enforce the laws. The legislation would come into effect 12 months after the vote.


### Disagreement by some experts

Most experts think that it is the right choice to ban social media for young people but not all experts agree. Some of them think that it will only delay the exposure to social media and that it is better to just teach children how to use social media. In the past European Union failed to give restrictions for youngsters and questions remain on how would the age verification work.

### Disagreement by Australian Child Rights Taskforce 

In October, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce, along with over 100 academics and 20 civil society organizations, asked the government to enforce safety standards for social media rather than a ban. 
Prime Minister Albanese, when questioned about just educating children on safe online practices, said that education alone would not be enough.
