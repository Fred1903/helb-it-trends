## Python is now the most used language on Github

Javascript was since 10 years the most used language on Github, in 2024 it was Python !

---

### Introduction

After being on the second place for five years Python dethrones Javascript and becomes the most used languages on Github. Javascript is just switching place with Python and is now second. Typescript is also increasing but PHP continues to decrease.

### Boom of Generative AI 

The reason of this change is nothing else than the boom of generative AI since the arrival of ChatGpt. In deed Github noted that Jupyter Notebooks, the open-source web development notebooks designed for data science, increased by 92 percent ! Generative AI projects increased also by 98 percent !


### AI helps developers

In 2024 there are also a lot of people which used Github Copilot in their projects. This means that people don't use only AI to write code but also to learn and help becoming a better developer. 
But AI is changing what it means to be a developer,  a developer is not just a coder with expertise in computer science but can also be a researcher for machine learning, a data scientist, a mathematician or else.


### Other languages

Typescript is still on third place since last year with a lot of users and Java which had his place stolen stays also on 4th place. The rest of the ranking is stable with C# followed by C++, PHP, SHell, C and ObjC, Ruby and Go on 10th place.
